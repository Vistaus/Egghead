If you find this app useful, do consider contributing. If you are wondering how,
you can contribute in the following ways:

- Report bugs if you encounter some. There are probably a handful of them.
- You can also contribute code. If it is a bug fix, do open a pull request(PR). However,
if it is a new feature, first open an issue so that we discuss it before opening
a PR.

1. Download [GNOME builder](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Builder). It's the
 fastest way to get up and running.

 screen.
1. Use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> keyboard
combination to run the project after opening it in GNOME builder. You can also

 ## Translation

 The quiz is sourced from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) in English.
 Therefore, I don't think it makes sense to translate the app.
